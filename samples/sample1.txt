We need a task management app for small teams. Users should be able to create projects, add tasks to those projects, assign tasks to team members, set due dates, and mark tasks as complete. It would be great if users can comment on tasks and get notifications when they're assigned something new or when a due date is approaching. Also, there should be a dashboard showing progress on projects, like how many tasks are done vs pending. Admins should be able to invite new users and manage roles. Everything should be web-based and mobile-friendly.
