Build an e-commerce platform for selling digital courses. Customers can browse courses by category, view details like curriculum, instructor bio, reviews, and price. They need to register/login to purchase. After buying, they get lifetime access to the course materials (videos, PDFs, quizzes). Instructors should have a dashboard to upload content, track student progress, and see earnings. Add support for discount codes and basic analytics on sales. Payment via Stripe.
