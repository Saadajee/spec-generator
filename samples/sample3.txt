Create a fitness tracking app. Users sign up and log their workouts: type (run, cycle, weights, etc.), duration, distance if applicable, and how they felt. The app should show progress charts over time, like weekly mileage or calories burned. Include a social feature where users can follow friends and see their recent activities in a feed. Also need goals setting – like "run 100km this month" with progress bars. Push notifications for reminders to log workouts. Sync with Apple Health/Google Fit would be nice but not required yet.
