Internal tool for expense reporting. Employees submit expenses with amount, date, category (travel, meals, supplies), and attach receipt photos. Expenses go to their manager for approval or rejection with comments. Once approved, they’re sent to finance for reimbursement. Need reports: monthly expenses per employee, per department, and total spend by category. Admins can set spending limits per category. Export to CSV for accounting. Users should get email notifications on status changes.
