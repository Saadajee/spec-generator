Event management system for conferences. Organizers create events with name, date, location, description. They can add multiple sessions/speakers with schedules. Attendees register, choose sessions they want to attend (if there are tracks), and buy tickets (different tiers: early bird, regular, VIP). After registration, they get QR code tickets via email. On-site check-in via scanning QR codes. Post-event surveys. Dashboard for organizers showing registration numbers, revenue, attendance rates.
