Simple customer support ticket system. Customers submit tickets with subject, description, priority, and optional attachments. Support agents see a queue of open tickets, can assign to themselves or others, add internal notes, and reply to customers. Tickets can be in states: new, open, pending, resolved, closed. Need SLA tracking – e.g., first response within 4 hours. Reporting: average resolution time, tickets per agent, customer satisfaction scores from post-resolution surveys. Integration with email so tickets can be created from incoming support emails.
